This is an undergrad course project for <b> ITEC4220 Database Management Systems </b> at York University in Winter 2022 Semester.

 - In collaboration with my teammates Karanvir and Shennaz. 


The project consists of three milestones. <b> This repo only includes queries created for Milestone2 and Milestone3. </b>

# Milestone 1 System Design
1. System Definition
    - Identify the scope of your database
    - Describe the problem domain
2. Conceptual Design
    - Create Class Diagram for a database

# Milestone 2 Logical database design and implementation
1. Create Logical Schema
2. Create 9 SQL queries including:
    - A query demonstrating that MAP method declared in the corresponding data type works (you are to use ORDER BY VALUE(...) clause)
    - A query demonstrating that ORDER method declared in the corresponding data type works (you may use ORDER BY VALUE(...) clause or call the method directly)
    - A query demonstrating that the method from the supertype which was overridden in a subtype works.
    - All queries are to be based on object-relational features and retrieve data from more than one object table. 
 
 # Milestone 3 Working with XML data
 1. Formulate 28 requests based on the Oracle database created in Milestone2
 2. Formulate 12 SQL stations with Oracle XML functions
 3. Formulate 4 request create XML documents using Oracle XSU
 4. Formulate 12 queries in XQuery
